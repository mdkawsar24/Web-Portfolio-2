        <!--  Everyone has an ambition in his life; some of us want to become doctor, engineer etc. and
            some want to get good marks in exams. If our goals appear in our mind which doesn’t let us sleep is known as dream. What we
            think about achieving the goal is reflected in our dream. It is our dream which drives us to convert it into
            a reality. As we know it was the dream of our freedom fighters to make our Bangladesh independent, hence by
            regular efforts they turned their dream into reality by getting independence. Our dreams give us positive energy to do everything to achieve it. Dreams come to every living being including humans and they have the capacity to turn their dreams into reality. -->
